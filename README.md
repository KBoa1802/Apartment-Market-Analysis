This project was completed as a capstone for the ERM 413 course. It explores rental listings in Greensboro, NC, to build predictive models for rental prices and to perform cluster analysis for categorizing apartments based on their characteristics.

# Project Overview
Using a dataset of apartment listings—including rental prices, amenities, and geolocation data—the project aimed to:

Predict rental prices based on features like bedrooms, square footage, location, and amenities.

Cluster apartments into groups based on price, size, and features to assist renters and marketers.

Visualize clusters on an interactive map using geolocation data.

# Key Features
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Used dplyr, tidyr, and regular expressions to tidy and enhance the dataset.

Predictive Modeling: Built and compared multiple linear regression models to estimate rental prices.

Clustering Analysis: Performed hierarchical clustering and used a scree plot to determine optimal cluster count.

Geospatial Visualization: Created an interactive leaflet map to visualize clusters of apartment listings by location.

# Insights & Reflections
This project taught me how to:

Build predictive models from real-world data

Apply clustering techniques to group similar data points

Communicate technical findings to non-technical stakeholders

Utilize multiple visualization tools to present results effectively
